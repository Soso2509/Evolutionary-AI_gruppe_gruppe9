1. [Ant Colony Optimization](#1-run-ant-colony-optimization-aco)
2. [Particle Swarm Optimization](#2-run-particle-swarm-optimization-pso)


## 1. Run Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
Will print the best found vehicle routes in the terminal and the total cost of it.
Also shows a visualisation of the routes taken by each vehicle.
```bash
python .\prob3\2.prob3_kode\aco_program.py
```

## 2. Run Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

```bash
python .\prob3\2.prob3_kode\pso_program.py
```
