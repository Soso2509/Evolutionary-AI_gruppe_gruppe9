To run project 4 the following is  are required:

Jupyter notebook to read the Taxi.ipynb file

Dependencies:
    Gym
    matplotlib
    moviepy
    pygame
    numpy version 1.26.3

If the code does run not in the notebook, try extracting them to individual python files

If DDQN does not provide feasable results follow these steps:
    1. Try again, sometimes the algorithm does not find a suitable solution within the 2000 episodes
    2. Try restarting the IDE to flush the cache (pytorch)
